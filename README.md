# TicTacToe
Making a simple TicTacToe game for two players
- Begin: 16 February 2021

# Files
> Only one file - main.cpp wil be used

# Functions
> Several functions in main.cpp
> 
> I need to save the values in each box
> 
> I need to draw the board with each entry after each turn
> 
> I need to figure out who has won at the end of each turn (or at earliest turn 5, which is turn 3 of player 1)
> 
>   This can be done without valdiating each possible winning combination.
>   
>   Instead, I know that there are only certain ways a game can be won:
>   
>     1. An entire row is filled with one player's symbol
>     
>     2. An entire column is filled with one player's symbol
>     
>     3. A majour diagonal is filled with one player's symbol
>     

# Notes
> Symbols will be X and O for Players 1 and 2, respectively

# Completion
- 17 February 2021
